# ESP32_SoftWire
ESP32 Arduino bit banged fast I2C library, drop in replacement for Wire.h

The library reaches up to 3 MHz I2C clock speed. No fancy bits and bobs: no timeouts, no clock stretching, blocking only... Made for fast IMU sensor reading were an occasional missed read does not matter, but bus hangups do matter.

Tested on ESP32, might work on other ESP32 variants.

Limitation: pins 0-31 only

## Background

As of December 2023 the official [arduino-esp32 Wire](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/Wire) library has some nasty bugs. In particular, there is a *1 second* timeout which hangs the bus on a bad read, and this timeout can not be lowered without changing the source code, see https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/4999 and https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/5934. So occasionally (a couple times per minute) 1000 samples are missed when you are reading a sensor at 1 kHz.
